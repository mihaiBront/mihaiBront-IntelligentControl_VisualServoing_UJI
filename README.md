## 1. Concept of the project:

This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence into robot control systems, specifically through the use of artificial neural networks. It builds on previous work with vision-based control approaches and aims to develop a neural network-based controller that can replace traditional control strategies.
## 2. FIRST TASK: Generate a datasets

The goal is to generate a dataset (for training, validation, and testing) by simulating a traditional control system. These datasets will serve as the learning foundation for a neural network. The data is created by running a vision-based controller and recording relevant control inputs and outputs
### 2.1 How to run the code:

**Create the python environment, for which:**

a) You must have **python installed**

b) You can either run (from the root directory of the project):
``` bash
source scripts/.prepare_environment.bash
```

c) Or run the build task made for preparing the environment (from VSCode):
```
F1 > Tasks: Run Build Task > Setup Python Environment
```
This will install all necessary dependencies for running the code

With the environment created, and all the requirements met. The **generation can be started**. 
For testing, there is a script that can be run like:
```bash
source scripts/DATASET_GenerateFullDataSet.bash
```
For running the full dataset generation (defaulting to 20K sequences), there is another script:

### 2.2 General explication of the code

The main script creates a `IVBS` object with the following constraints to make the data consistent:
- **Camera**: `CenteredCamera` with default parameters (with a random position for each sequence)
- **Points to follow**: Set of 4 points, created with the `mkgrid()` method, with a side of 0.5 and a random position in space, forming a plain parallel to the image plain
**Note that:** *For all parameters' random positions, minimum and maximum distances to the* $P(0,0,0)$ *have been set just so the points are not too far away*

#### **Drone Vision Metaphor: Understanding the Training Scenario** 🚁

To better understand the training setup, imagine a **drone equipped with a camera** learning to land on a **square landing pad**:

**The Scenario:**
- **🎯 Target**: A square landing pad (0.5m × 0.5m) lying flat on the ground
- **📹 Drone Camera**: Looking down at the landing pad from various positions above
- **🎯 Goal**: Navigate the drone so the landing pad appears centered in the camera view
- **🎮 Control**: The drone can move in 3D space (vx, vy, vz) to achieve perfect alignment

**Training Constraints (Simplified for Learning):**
- **Fixed Orientation**: The landing pad always lies **flat and parallel** to the ground (no rotation)
- **No Roll/Pitch**: The drone maintains level flight (no angular velocities needed)
- **Pure Translation**: Only linear movements required - like a camera on a 3-axis slider system
- **Consistent Target**: Always the same square pattern, only position varies

**Why This Simplification?**
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates rotational dynamics to focus on positional control
- **Faster Learning**: Neural network can concentrate on translation patterns
- **Real-world Relevance**: Many applications (landing, inspection, tracking) involve stable targets
- **Progressive Training**: Master simple cases before advancing to full 6DOF control

This constraint means all target squares are **horizontal and aligned** - like landing pads, fiducial markers on tables, or inspection targets on flat surfaces. The neural network learns to map "what I see" (current camera view) to "how I should move" (velocity commands) for this simplified but practical scenario.

Then, for each sequence, the `IVBS` controller is ran step by step and the data from its control is collected in a list of `RowData` objects (defined in `lib/DataStoring.py`) to then be serialized in bunches to save some space in memory.
#### Other involved files

Libraries inside `{root}/lib`:
- `DataStoring`: In charge of storing the data to a specified file in CSV format, with each row containing a complete state of the system
- `IBVSMachineLearning`: Implementation of the ML-based IBVS controller that will replace the traditional control law
### 2.3 Dataset structure

The dataset contains information that can be divided into two groups, depending on whether they will be used as **input** or **output** for training the Machine Learning algorithm
#### Inputs:

- `current_features`: The positions on the image plane (in $px$) of the arranged points, as seen by the camera in a certain moment. Set of four points, with two coordinates each $(x, y)$, flattened into a vector of size 8.

#### Outputs:
- `velocity_command`: Camera velocity command consisting of linear velocities [vx, vy, vz], vector of size 3
  - **Note**: Angular velocities (wx, wy, wz) are present in the dataset but contain only numerical noise (≈1e-15) and are excluded from training

#### Additional data:
Each row in the dataset also includes:
- `sequence_id`: Identifier for the sequence of movements
- `timestep`: Current step within the sequence
- `desired_features`: The positions on the image plane (in $px$) of the arranged points, as desired when the position is final and correct. Set of four points, with two coordinates each $(x, y)$, flattened into a vector of size 8.
- `feature_error`: Scalar value representing the norm of the feature error between current and desired positions

> Comments about these parameters:
> - `sequence_id` and `timestamp` are paraameters just to keep track of which sequence and which position each line is from
> - `desired_features` could be used for training if we wanted a more generalistic model that could account for any desired robot position, but we will keep to a known set of desired positions to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. However, these values will be saved just for data consistency purposes.
> - `feature_error` will be used to check the validity of the system

## 3. SECOND TASK: Design the training process

### 3.2 Dataset Corrections and Findings

**Important Discovery:** Analysis of the generated dataset revealed that angular velocities (wx, wy, wz) contain only numerical noise (≈1e-15), effectively making this a **3DOF control problem** rather than 6DOF.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated target columns from `['vx', 'vy', 'vz', 'wx', 'wy', 'wz']` to `['vx', 'vy', 'vz']`
- Modified all model configurations to output 3 values instead of 6
- This resolved training issues where loss was stuck at 0.5

**Dataset Statistics:**
- Total samples: 1,686,070
- Input features: 8 (current_feature_0 through current_feature_7)
- Output targets: 3 (vx, vy, vz only)
- Linear velocity ranges: ±0.66 m/s
- Angular velocities: Effectively zero (numerical noise only)

### 3.3 Model Architecture Analysis

Several neural network architectures can be considered for learning the IBVS control law. Here's an analysis of potential approaches:

#### 3.1.1 Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
**How it works:**
- Information flows in one direction, from input to output through layers of neurons
- Each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function
- No cycles or loops in the network structure
- Learns direct mappings between inputs and outputs through backpropagation

## 5. TROUBLESHOOTING AND KEY FIXES

### 5.1 Understanding Validation Loss Lower Than Training Loss

**Observation:** During training, you may notice that validation loss is consistently lower than training loss. This is actually a normal and expected behavior in our IBVS neural network training, not an error. Here's why this occurs:

#### 5.1.1 Regularization Applied During Training Only ✅

Our models use several regularization techniques that are **only active during training**:

**Dropout Regularization:**
- **FNN Model**: 30% dropout rate (`dropout_rate: 0.3`)
- **LSTM Model**: 20% dropout rate (`dropout_rate: 0.2`) 
- **ResNet Model**: 20% dropout rate in residual blocks
- **Hybrid Model**: 20% dropout rate in CNN and LSTM layers

During training, dropout randomly disables neurons, making the network work harder and appear to have higher loss. During validation, dropout is disabled (`model.eval()`), allowing the full network capacity to be used, resulting in better performance.

**Batch Normalization:**
- **FNN Model**: Uses `BatchNorm1d` layers (`use_batch_norm: True`)
- During training: Uses batch statistics (mean/variance of current mini-batch)
- During validation: Uses global statistics (running averages), providing more stable and consistent normalization

**Weight Decay (L2 Regularization):**
- Applied during training: `weight_decay=1e-3` in Adam optimizer
- Penalizes large weights during training but doesn't affect validation evaluation
- Makes training loss appear higher while improving generalization

#### 5.1.2 Loss Function Computation Differences ✅

**Mini-batch vs Full Dataset Evaluation:**
- **Training Loss**: Computed per mini-batch (batch_size=64), then averaged across batches
- **Validation Loss**: Computed over entire validation set in one pass
- Mini-batch variance can make training loss appear higher due to batch-to-batch fluctuations

**Model State Differences:**
```python
# Training mode (in train_epoch function)
model.train()  # Enables dropout, batch norm uses batch stats

# Validation mode (in validate function)  
model.eval()   # Disables dropout, batch norm uses global stats
```

#### 5.1.3 Data Distribution and Sampling ✅

**Validation Set Characteristics:**
- **Size**: 20% of total dataset (VAL_SPLIT = 0.2)
- **Sampling**: Random split ensures representative distribution
- **Consistency**: Fixed validation set provides stable evaluation baseline

**Training Data Augmentation Effects:**
- While we don't use explicit data augmentation, the random mini-batch sampling during training exposes the model to different data combinations each epoch
- Validation uses the same data consistently, allowing for more stable loss computation

#### 5.1.4 Early Training Dynamics ✅

**Learning Phase Characteristics:**
- **Early Epochs**: Model may accidentally perform better on validation due to initialization
- **Mid Training**: Training loss typically becomes lower as model memorizes training patterns
- **Late Training**: Regularization prevents overfitting, keeping validation competitive

#### 5.1.5 Expected Behavior Patterns

**Healthy Training Indicators:**
1. **Converging Losses**: Both training and validation losses should generally decrease
2. **Stable Gap**: Small, consistent difference between training and validation loss
3. **No Divergence**: Validation loss shouldn't consistently increase while training decreases

**Warning Signs (Overfitting):**
1. **Diverging Losses**: Training loss continues decreasing while validation loss increases
2. **Large Gap**: Training loss much lower than validation loss (>2x difference)
3. **Oscillating Validation**: Validation loss becomes erratic while training is smooth

#### 5.1.6 Monitoring and Analysis

**Real-time Monitoring:**
Our web interface (`http://localhost:5000`) shows both losses with clear visualization:
- Blue line: Training loss progression
- Red line: Validation loss progression  
- Gold star: Best validation loss epoch
- Early stopping triggers when validation loss stops improving

**Example from FNN Training:**
```json
"train_losses": [0.520, 0.380, 0.346, ...],
"val_losses": [0.153, 0.104, 0.104, ...],
"best_val_loss": 0.03789775519556917,
"best_epoch": 36
```

Notice how validation loss (0.153) starts much lower than training loss (0.520) due to regularization effects.

#### 5.1.7 Technical Implementation Details

**Code References:**
- Training loop: `lib/BaseModelTrainer.py:train()` 
- Model modes: `lib/DataLoading.py:train_epoch()` and `validate()`
- Regularization configs: `model_training/config.py`

**Key Functions:**
```python
# Training with regularization active
def train_epoch(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, device):
    model.train()  # Enables dropout, batch norm training mode
    
# Validation with regularization disabled  
def validate(model, val_loader, criterion, device):
    model.eval()   # Disables dropout, batch norm eval mode
```

**Conclusion:** Validation loss being lower than training loss is **expected and healthy** in our implementation due to the extensive regularization techniques used. This indicates the model is learning generalizable patterns rather than memorizing training data.

### 5.2 Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: Loss stuck at 0.5 and not decreasing**
- **Root Cause**: Dataset contained 6 target outputs but only 3 had meaningful values
- **Solution**: Analyzed dataset and discovered angular velocities were numerical noise
- **Fix**: Changed from 6DOF to 3DOF output (vx, vy, vz only)

**Problem: Training loss decreasing but validation loss oscillating**
- **Root Cause**: Model overfitting due to high complexity
- **Solution**: Reduced model complexity and increased regularization
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Simplified FNN architecture: [256,128,64,32] → [64,32]
  - Increased dropout: 0.1 → 0.3
  - Added weight decay: 1e-4 → 1e-3
  - Reduced learning rate: 0.001 → 0.0005

**Problem: Web interface not accessible from phone**
- **Root Cause**: Flask server bound to localhost only
- **Solution**: Configure server to accept external connections
- **Fix**: Set `host='0.0.0.0'` in Flask app.run()
- **Access**: Use computer's IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:5000)

#### 6.1.2 Model Loading and Architecture

**Automatic Model Configuration:**
```python
def load_model(self):
    # Load model metadata for architecture configuration
    metadata = json.load(open(f"{self.model_path}/lstm_metadata.json"))
    config = metadata['model_config']
    
    # Create LSTM architecture matching training
    self.model = LSTMModel(
        input_size=config['input_size'],      # 8 features
        hidden_size=config['hidden_size'],    # 64 units
        num_layers=config['num_layers'],      # 2 layers
        output_size=config['output_size'],    # 3 velocities
        dropout_rate=config['dropout_rate']   # 0.2
    )
```

**LSTM Architecture Details:**

current_features_scaled = self.feature_scaler.transform(current_features)

# Model prediction
velocity_scaled = self.model.predict(sequence_batch)

# Target scaling (output denormalization)  
velocity_command = self.target_scaler.inverse_transform(velocity_scaled)
```

#### 6.1.3 Real-time Control Integration

**Control Loop Implementation:**
```python
def step(self, t):
    """Compute one timestep of ML-based IBVS simulation"""
    # Get current image feature points
    current_points = self.camera.project_point(self.P)
    
    # Prepare input features for the model (8 values: 4 points × 2 coordinates)
    current_features = current_points.flatten(order='F')
    features = current_features.astype(np.float64)
    
    # Normalize features using loaded scaler
    if self.feature_scaler is not None:
        features = self.feature_scaler.transform(features.reshape(1, -1)).flatten()
    
    # Convert to tensor and predict velocity
    features_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(features).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension
    with torch.no_grad():
        prediction = self.model(features_tensor)
    
    # Denormalize prediction and format output
    if self.target_scaler is not None:
        prediction_np = prediction.cpu().numpy()
        v_linear = self.target_scaler.inverse_transform(prediction_np).flatten()
        v = np.concatenate([v_linear, np.zeros(3)])  # [vx, vy, vz, 0, 0, 0]
    
    # Update camera pose and history
    Td = SE3.Delta(v)
    self.camera.pose @= Td
    
    return status  # 0: running, 1: completed, -1: error
```

1. **Learned Optimization**: Neural network learns optimal control policies from 1.6M training examples
2. **Temporal Awareness**: LSTM memory enables smoother, more predictable trajectories  
3. **Implicit Modeling**: Captures camera-target relationships that classical methods approximate
4. **Data-Driven Tuning**: Training automatically optimizes for the specific scenario constraints

**Training Scenario Validation:**
The results confirm that when tested under training-like conditions (horizontal square targets, similar camera positions), the ML approach significantly outperforms classical methods, validating our training methodology.

### 6.4 Implementation Insights and Lessons Learned

#### 6.4.1 Technical Challenges Solved

**Model Architecture Matching:**
- **Challenge**: Loading trained models without access to training framework
- **Solution**: Metadata-driven architecture reconstruction with automatic parameter loading

**Sequence Processing Integration:**
- **Challenge**: Adapting sequence-based LSTM to real-time control loop
- **Solution**: Sliding window buffer with safe initialization and graceful degradation

**Normalization Pipeline:**
- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent data preprocessing between training and inference
- **Solution**: Persistent scaler objects saved during training and loaded during deployment

#### 6.4.2 Performance Optimization

**Efficient Model Loading:**
```python
# One-time model setup
def __init__(self, ...):
    self.model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path + '/lstm_best.pth'))
    self.model.eval()  # Disable training-specific layers
    
# Fast inference during control
def predict_velocity(self):
    with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient computation
        return self.model(sequence_tensor).numpy()
```

**Memory Management:**
- **Sequence Buffer**: Fixed-size deque prevents memory accumulation
- **Tensor Operations**: Efficient numpy/torch conversions
- **Model State**: Persistent model in evaluation mode

#### 6.4.3 Integration Benefits

**Seamless Replacement:**
The `IBVSMachineLearning` class inherits from the standard `IBVS` class, making it a drop-in replacement for existing control systems:

```python
# Traditional approach
classical_controller = IBVS(camera, P=P, p_d=pd)

# ML-enhanced approach  
ml_controller = IBVSMachineLearning(camera, P=P, p_d=pd, model_path="training_models")

# Identical interface for both
classical_controller.run(50)
ml_controller.run(100)
```

**Consistent Interface:**
- Same initialization parameters and methods
- Compatible with existing robotics frameworks
- Minimal code changes required for adoption
- Maintains all original functionality (plotting, logging, etc.)
