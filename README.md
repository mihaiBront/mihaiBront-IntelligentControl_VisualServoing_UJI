# Intelligent Control Training for Image-Based Visual Servoing

## Table of contents


## 1. Concept of the project:

This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence into robot control systems, specifically through the use of artificial neural networks. It builds on previous work with vision-based control approaches and aims to develop a neural network-based controller that can replace traditional control strategies.

## 2. FIRST TASK: Generate a datasets

The goal is to generate a dataset (for training, validation, and testing) by simulating a traditional control system. These datasets will serve as the learning foundation for a neural network. The data is created by running a vision-based controller and recording relevant control inputs and outputs

### 2.1 How to run the code:


### 2.2 General explication of the code


## 3. SECOND TASK: Design the training process

Using the datasets generated in Task 1, this task focuses on designing, training, and validating a neural network that mimics the behavior of a traditional controller. Once trained, the network is integrated into the control loop to act as the decision-making module in place of the conventional controller.
